The styling of SharePoint 2007 was not Microsoft's greatest work. In today's world of sexy CSS and modern browser, SP-2007 is looking very very very dated but it doesn't have to be this way. With a little TLC and hard work, SharePoint 2007 can look good, even in IE8.

During a recent redesign of my client's SharePoint portal, I was able to update the style and markup into something a little more modern. It was not easy and it took a lot of tweaking and jimmying to get IE8 to resemble Chrome and vise versa. The results speak for themselves.

## before

This is default blue theme with some header adjustments. Images are blurred to protect the innocent.

![before]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/sp-before.png)

## after

The same page as above but with a little more panache.

![after]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/sp-after.png)

I normally don't do design work like this but it's very satisfying cleaning up the inter-tubes of uglies. You might never have to re-style a SharePoint portal but if you do, remember it's just markup, CSS and a lot of hard work.

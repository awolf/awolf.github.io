Success, mission accomplished. I have successfully committed non-trivial code to my GitHub repositories for the past 30 days. Even on Thanksgiving day. This effort was all a part of the "National Novel Writing Month" but with a developer's learning twist.

I am not really into writing fiction or non fiction but what I am interested in is learning more. My goal for this month of hustle was to complete two NodeJS books by reading the chapters, typing out all the code samples and doing all the exercises. My GitHub repositories under NodeJS are now packed with my learning and exploring.

GitHub has a wonderful graphic on each users home page that tracks commit history and streaks. My previous streak was three days. Not very impressive, but my new streak of 30 days is very exciting and I don't want to break the chain. 

You might have heard the same advice from people like Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry's advice is simple. If you want to get better at something, you're going to have to practice or do it every day. His "don't break the chain" advice is simple, log when you practice and try to do it every day. He uses a big yearly calendar and fat red markers to show his chains. 

If you want to get better, don't break the chain. So with 30 days down what's next! AngularJS. I have used it for prototyping and one information dashboard project at my current client and I must say it's great. Learning more about AngularJS might be what puts my streak over the 40 mark.

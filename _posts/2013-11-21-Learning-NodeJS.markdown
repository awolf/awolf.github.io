Well, I took the plunge; I bought “Node In Action” from Manning Press and finished it last night. [Here][GitHub] is my GitHub repo for the code. When I read programming books, I type along with the author in an effort to learn more. The book was fantastic, well written and technically excellent. I had no difficulties with the sample code, which in other books, can be an issue.

One of the most interesting thing about Node, besides the fact that we can write JavaScript on the server, was its package manager NPM and the plethora of helpful, well focused modules. Nuget is Microsoft’s equivalent of NPM. I ran into only one issue with a package from NPM and it was caused by an outdated version of Python on my Mac. After a simple upgrade to Python 2.7 everything worked perfectly.

The Express web application framework and its cohort Connect was the most interesting package used in the book. Using Express was similar to using Nancy or Sinatra, each are a minimal web framework and are bare bones, not like the full featured Asp.Net MVC or Rails. This bare bones approach makes developing simple web applications fast and easy. 

For the book I developed on my Mac Pro using a combination of Vim and Sublime Text. For source control I used Git. If I needed to develop on windows, I would have used Visual Studio and the new Node.js Tools which was just released today. The tools look great and I can’t wait to give them a try.

All in all, I think learning more about Node is in every developer’s best interest. I know you might not particularly like the JavaScript language and its idiosyncrasies but Node and its package manager will have you wishing for its simplicity on your own stack.

So yeah JavaScript on the server, who knew!

It's that time again; time to update the blog. I was using Google's Blogspot to host my old blog but who knows know how long Blogspot is going last, especially with Google shutting down Reader. This blog is now hosted on Github.io pages and uses the static site generator Jekyll.

If you don't know Jekyll you are missing out on a great open source static site generator that has some great features for us technical bloggers.

##The Jekyll goods:
* Generated sites are blazing fast.
* Create content with my trusty code editor
* Markdown support
* Pygments code colorizer
* Liquid Templates

Hosting on Github.io is a breeze and deploying changes are as simple as a Github checking. In addition to great hosting you get source control for free. If your looking for a change give Jekyll and Github pages a try.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll's GitHub repo][jekyll-gh].

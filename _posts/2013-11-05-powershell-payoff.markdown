Programmers are like investors. but instead of stocks. we invest in technologies and instead of money we spend our time and sometimes money. The dizzying array of investment choices is daunting and picking the wrong one is troublesome. To say the least.

I admit, I did invest in Silverlight and lost my shirt. I don't even want to think about the hours I spent learning it and developing with it. On the brighter side, I did learn PowerShell this year and I must say, it was time well spent. 

PowerShell 3 has a nice integrated scripting environment and a boatload of "batteries included" modules. PowerShell is investment grade technology. With PowerShell, I have never gotten so much done with so few lines of (script) code. 

A word of warning, when your fellow colleagues learn of your PowerShell prowis, you are going to be popular! Just today I helped a database developer set the validate options on her 120 plus SSIS packages in nested folders with just a couple lines of PowerShell. 

I've just scratched the surface of PowerShell but I can tell you that my investment is paying off.

What should you teach a beginner, ASP.net Webforms or MVC? Recently a family member has taken up my offer to teach them programming on the Microsoft.Net stack. This family member, lets call him Bud, has some PHP experience that he picked up by himself. I love self learners, way to go Bud! With his current level of development knowledge what would be better to teach him? WebForms or MVC? The answer is neither!

With Bud's current knowledge the closes analogy from Microsoft would be WebMatrix with Razor views (cshtml). As a seasoned web developer, I had to look up WebMatrix and learn a little about it. The teacher (me) is going to have to learn more about WebMatrix before he teaches it.

I was initial concerned about teaching him with WebMatrix because I didn't want to waste his time learning something that would be a throw away. After looking into it, it's a great way to start a new developer off and it has the "Edit in Visual Studio" button built right in. Obviously Microsoft has made WebMatrix the on-ramp to the Microsoft stack. 

Starting Bud off in web matrix with the Razor views will help make the transition to MVC easier on him later. I think we all know that Asp.Net WebForms is going away and the future for web development on the Microsoft platform will be MVC.

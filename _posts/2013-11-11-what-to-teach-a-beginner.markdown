What should you teach a beginner, ASP.net Webforms or ASP.Net MVC? Recently a family member has taken up my offer to teach them programming on the Microsoft.Net stack. This family member, let's call him Bud, has some PHP experience that he picked up by himself. I love self learners; way to go Bud! With his current level of development knowledge what would be better to teach him? WebForms or MVC? The answer is neither!

With Bud's current knowledge the closest analogy from Microsoft would be ASP.Net Web Pages. As a seasoned web developer, I had to look up ASP.Net Web Pages and the editor WebMatrix and learn a little about it. The teacher (me) is going to have to learn more about WebMatrix and ASP.Net Web Pages before he teaches it.

I was initially concerned about teaching him ASP.Net Web Pages and WebMatrix because I didn't want to waste his time learning something that would be a throw away. After looking into it, it's a great way to start a new developer off. Bud will learn the same Razor syntax as used in ASP.net MVC. Microsoft has made WebMatrix and ASP.Net Web Pages the on-ramp to the full Microsoft stack of technologies. 

Starting Bud off in ASP.Net Web Pages with the Razor views will help make the transition to MVC easier on him later. I think we all know that Asp.Net WebForms is going away and the future for web development on the Microsoft platform will be MVC.

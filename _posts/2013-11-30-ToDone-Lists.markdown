#To Done Lists

If you're going to be productive, tracking your progress is important. For me it needs to be dead simple, motivational and obvious. I use a simple paper and pen system called ToDone lists. I know what you're thinking, paper and pen, piff! 

ToDone lists consist of one list for important things that need to get done today and another to track everything else. Simple, and it has an added benefit of not freaking you out when you look at a list with a kajillion items on it. I have been using this system for a few years and I love crossing things off the "to" side and don't feel bad adding something to the "done" side. Hey, it's done, who can argue with that.

### Dead Simple

What could be simpler than a piece of paper, a pen and a plan? Not much and the pen keeps you honest; there's no erasing, rewriting or editing. Our goal is to cross stuff off the "to" side before putting a whole bunch of stuff on the done side. It's going to get messy, it always does, so start writing.

### Beginning of the Day

I start off the day with a piece of 8 1/2 x 11 copy paper folded in half. I write the to-do on the front cover and the done list on the back. Keep it handy, you will be updating it often.

You might be asking yourself "What should I put on the 'to-do' side?". Put your top 3 to 5 most important tasks on the front. Don't go crazy and overwhelm yourself with too many things. You can always add later. The goal here is to focus and not to abuse yourself.

__Here is a typical start of the day ToDone lists.__  

| To | Done |
|:- | :- |
| Add sorting to employee table       | |
| Add Report PowerShell to Scheduler  | |
| Fix bug: 234 on Project A           | |

### End of the Day

As you can see on my 'done' list, stuff just keeps coming out of the woodwork, but my 'to-do' list is complete. It's nice at the end of the day to look back and see all the things that you have accomplished. 

| To | Done |
| :- | :- |
| X Add sorting to employee table | Helped John with his css issue |
| X Add Report PowerShell to scheduler  | Scrum Meeting  |
| X Fix bug: 234 on Project A  | Planning meeting |
| | Mock-up UI for feature 3843 |
| | Email vendor for price quot |
| | Fix build server Nuget package |

Real life is messy and your tasks might not all be completed at the end of the day; that's OK. You now have a head start on making tomorrow's list.

### Motivational 

I love crossing things off my 'to-do' list. It's cathartic and a nice reminder that stuff gets done at your desk. I don't keep my daily lists but if you have to do status reports then using the ToDone lists will make them easier.

### Obvious

At the end of the day, it's obvious whether you succeeded or not. The ToDone lists has the added benefit of tracking all those little things that you do during the day. Sometimes a good plan goes out the window but if the three things on the 'to-do' side are the most important then focusing on them is a good idea.

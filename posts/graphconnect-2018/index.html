      <p>One of the best parts of my job is how much I get to learn about topics that I have previously only heard of. One of those things was graph databases and how they can be used and abused for connected data.</p>
      
      <p><img class="aligncenter" src="/posts/graphconnect-2018/gcny-2017-logo-pw2x.png"  width="800" /></p>
      
      <p>I was lucky enough to go to this year's GraphConnect 2018 in New York City this September 20-21 at the Marriott in Times Square. As a person who grew up on Long Island and worked in New York City, this was an interesting homecoming for me.</p>
    
      <h2>The Conference</h2>
    
      <p>The conference was a well put together affair and I did learn a ton of stuff about how graphs are used in other industries, the intersection of graph databases, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and AI in general.</p>
    
      <h3>Talks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>State of the Graph: Opening Keynote</li>
        <li>The Present and Future of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</li>
        <li>Neo4j Graph Platform for Demographics Master Data at Citigroup</li>
        <li>Predictive Analysis from Massive Knowledge Graphs on Neo4j</li>
        <li>Neo4j Morpheus: Interweaving Table and Graph Data in Spark</li>
        <li>Large-scale real time recommendations with Neo4j</li>
        <li>DeepWalk - Turning Graphs into Features via Network Embeddings</li>
        <li>How Graph Technology is Changing Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</li>
        <li>Infinite Segmentation: Scalable Mutual Information Ranking on real world graphs</li>
        <li>Machine Learning Algorithms in Neo4j</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h3Classes</h3>
    
      <ul>
        <li>Neo4j for Data Science and Machine Learning</li>
        <li>Graph Modeling Clinic</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h2>Taking a Walk</h2>
      
      <p><img class="alignleft" src="/posts/graphconnect-2018/mountaineering-copy.png" alt="mountaineering copy" width="120" height="120" />I had a lot of fun at the conference, meeting new people and vendors selling everything from graph based analytics to ML training systems. The best talk of the whole conference was the "<em>DeepWalk - Turning Graphs into Features via Network Embeddings</em>". This talk was a standing room only talk from one of the <a href="https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/">authors</a> of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6652">paper</a> and was a lot of fun going through the paper and discussing how graphs can be used for feature extraction for our connected datasets and ML training grounds.</p>
    
      <p><img class=" size-full wp-image-176 alignright" src="/posts/graphconnect-2018/line_structure_relations_hierarchy.png" alt="line_structure_relations_hierarchy" width="120" height="120" />The first day was all talks while the next day was all learning. I took the Graph Modeling clinic to help me get over my propensity to design a data model like a RDBMS ERD diagram and the "Data Science and Machine Learning" course for the fun of learning more about Machine Learning and Model training.</p>
      
      <p>All in all, a nice conference with interesting speakers and training without a lot of pushy sales people. I have to hand it to Neo4j, they put on a nice conference.</p>

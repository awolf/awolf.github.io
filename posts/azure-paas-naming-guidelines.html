          <h2>Azure PaaS Naming Guidelines</h2>
          <p>A consistent naming pattern is one of the most important elements of predictability and discoverability in a communally used service like the Azure Platform. Widespread use and understanding of these naming guidelines should eliminate many of the most common user and developer questions. This document provides naming guidelines for the most commonly used service on the Azure platform. For each type, you should also take note of some general rules with respect to capitalization styles, case sensitivity and word choice.</p>
          <p>Windows Azure uses URL’s to address and locate services and objects in the cloud. Most of the naming rules follow standard DNS naming rules. The uniqueness constraint of URL addresses will make naming objects in different development environments difficult without a consistent strategy.</p>
          <p>In addition to uniqueness, we are also not the sole entity vying for space inside the Azure URL namespace. Another company can use the same namespace scheme and take well-defined names from your company.  In the event of a collision, you would have to find an alternative. This issue is akin to finding an available domain name in the .com domain suffix today.</p>
          <h3>Subscriptions</h3>
          <h4>Use Multiple Windows Azure Subscriptions</h4>
          <p>Subscriptions should be used to separate billing and to limit who can access the Windows Azure services associated with the subscriptions.</p>
          <h4>Use Descriptive Names for Windows Azure Subscriptions</h4>
          <p>When it comes to naming a Windows Azure subscription, it is good practice to use descriptive names. The name should follow the following format: CompanyName–ProjectName–Environment.</p>
          <p>Using the company name will make the subscription distinct in the list of an Azure user’s subscription list. This is critical for when your company hires a contractor or outside company to assist in developing Windows Azure services. We will most likely need to make them a co-administrator on a particular subscription. When that contractor/company logs into the Windows Azure portal, they see a list of all subscriptions they are associated with. So they might see: CustomerASubscription1, CustomerASubscription2, CustomerBSubscription1, etc. If we named our subscription “Development” and some other company named their subscription “Development,” then the contractor/company would see “Development” and “Development” in the list. This adds risk where they could accidentally perform some action on the wrong subscription.</p>
          <p>[ProjectName] is the name that your project is known by. The separation by project might seem like overkill but subscription is the base of access control. Administrators are granted access to everything in a single subscription.</p>
          <p>[Environment] is also used to constrict developer access to the Development and Test subscriptions.  Environment names will consist of the abbreviations for Development, Quality Assurance, and Pre-Production or Production.</p>
          <blockquote>We don’t recommend using an environment name of “Staging” because it can become confusing when Windows Azure deployments have two slots “Staging” and “Production”.</blockquote>
          <An>example of using multiple subscriptions might be:</An>
          <h5>Subscription 1</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Name: “CompanyName – Project 1 – Development”</li>
            <li>Service Administrator: Development Manager</li>
            <li>Co-Administrators: Developers on Project 1</li>
          </ul>
          <blockquote>A developer may not need to be a Co-Administrator but instead only require a Management Certificate.</blockquote>
          <h5>Subscription 2</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Name: “CompanyName – Project 1 – Test”</li>
            <li>Service Administrator: Test Manager</li>
            <li>Co-Administrator: Testers on Project 1</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Subscription 3</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Name: “CompanyName – Project 1 – Pre-Production”</li>
            <li>Service Administrator: IT Manager</li>
            <li>Co-Administrator: Senior IT Support Team (Level 3)</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Subscription 4</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Name: “CompanyName – Project 1 – Production”</li>
            <li>Service Administrator: IT Manager</li>
            <li>Co-Administrator: Senior IT Support Team (Level 3)</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Cloud Services</h3>
          <p>Cloud Service names must contain only letters, numbers, and hyphens. The first and last character in the field must be a letter or number. Trademarks, reserved words, and offensive words are not allowed. The name should follow the following format: ProjectName + CompanyName + Environment.</p>
          <p>Example: projectname + CompanyName + dev http://projectnameCompanyNamedev.cloudapp.net</p>
          <p>The Cloud Services name should match its Storage Account name.</p>
          <h3>Storage Accounts</h3>
          <p>Storage account names must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and use numbers and lower-case letters only. This name is the DNS prefix name and can be used to access blobs, queues, and tables in the storage account. The name should follow the following format: ProjectName + CompanyName + Environment.</p>
          <p>Example: projectname + CompanyName + dev</p>
          <p>For example:</p>
          <p>Service	Endpoint</p>
          <ul>
            <li> Blobs	http://projectnameCompanyNamedev.blob.core.windows.net/</li>
            <li> Tables	http:// projectnameCompanyNamedev.table.core.windows.net/</li>
            <li> Queues	http:// projectnameCompanyNamedev.queue.core.windows.net/</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The storage account name should match the Cloud Services name.</p>
          <h4>Table Names</h4>
          <p>Tables should be named based on the entity that will be stored in the table. For example, if you are storing student records, then the table should be named student. All table names should be the singular and not the plural of the entity. When the table is created under the projects development storage account, the table will be accessible at the URI http:// projectnameCompanyNamedev.table.core.windows.net/student.</p>
          <p>Table names must follow the following rules:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>	Must be unique within an account.</li>
            <li>	May contain only alphanumeric characters.</li>
            <li>	Cannot begin with a numeric character.</li>
            <li> Are case-insensitive.</li>
            <li>	Must be from 3 to 63 characters long.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Some table names are reserved, including "tables". Attempting to create a table with a reserved table name returns error code 404 (Bad Request). These rules are also described by the regular expression "^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]{2,62}$".</p>
          <h4>Container Names</h4>
          <p>Containers are used with the Blob store. Containers can keep blobs separated in the same storage container. A container name must be a valid DNS name.</p>
          <p>Container names must follow the following rules:</p>
          <ol>
            <li> Container names must start with a letter or number, and can contain only letters, numbers, and the dash (-) character.</li>
            <li> Every dash (-) character must be immediately preceded and followed by a letter or number; consecutive dashes are not permitted in container names.</li>
            <li> All letters in a container name must be lowercase.</li>
            <li> Container names must be from 3 through 63 characters long.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>When the “transfer” container is created under the projects development storage account, the container will be accessible at the URI http:// projectnameCompanyNamedev.blob.core.windows.net/transfer.</p>
          <h4>Blob Names</h4>
          <p>A blob name can contain any combination of characters, but reserved URL characters must be properly escaped. A blob name must be at least one character long and cannot be more than 1,024 characters long. Blob names are case-sensitive. Avoid blob names that end with a dot (.), a forward slash (/), or a sequence or combination of the two.</p>
          <p>The Blob service is based on a flat storage scheme, not a hierarchical scheme. However, you may specify a character or string delimiter within a blob name to create a virtual hierarchy. For example, the following list shows valid and unique blob names. Notice that a string can be valid as both a blob name and as a virtual directory name in the same container:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> /a</li>
            <li> /a.txt</li>
            <li> /a/b</li>
            <li>	/a/b.txt</li>
          </ul>
          <h4> Queue Names</h4>
          <p>Every queue within an account must have a unique name. The queue name must be a valid DNS name, and cannot be changed once created.</p>
          <p>Queue names must conform to the following rules:</p>
          <ol>
            <li> A queue name must start with a letter or number, and can only contain letters, numbers, and the dash (-) character.</li>
            <li> The first and last letters in the queue name must be alphanumeric. The dash (-) character cannot be the first or last character. Consecutive dash characters are not permitted in the queue name.</li>
            <li> All letters in a queue name must be lowercase.</li>
            <li>	A queue name must be from 3 through 63 characters long.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Service Bus</h3>
          <h4>Namespace</h4>
          <p>Namespaces are the root of the Service Bus service. Topics, queues and notification hubs hang off of this namespace. The namespace name has to be unique across Azure. The namespace name should follow the Storage Account and Cloud Service name.</p>
          <p>Namespace names must conform to the following rules:</p>
          <ol>
            <li> Name should be at least 6 and at most 50 characters long.</li>
            <li> The namespace must start with a letter, and it must end with a letter or number.</li>
            <li> Must be unique in the .servicebus.windows.net URL domain space.</li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Queues</h4>
          <p>Queue names should be named based on the message content. If you are storing messages about school registration requests, the queue name should be registration-request.</p>
          <p>Queue names must conform to the following rules:</p>
          <ol>
            <li> Name should be at least 1 and at most 50 characters long.</li>
            <li> The name can contain only letters, numbers, periods, hyphens, forward slashes, and underscores.</li>
            <li> The name must start and end with a letter or number.</li>
            <li> Must be unique in the [namespace].servicebus.windows.net\ URL namespace.</li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Topic</h4>
          <p>The topic name should reveal the type of data and message being published. For example the college-course topic is the place where a college and course message would be published from the “Transfer Evaluation Application”.</p>
          <p>Topic names must conform to the following rules:</p>
          <ol>
            <li> Name should be at least 1 and at most 50 characters long.</li>
            <li> The name can contain only letters, numbers, periods, hyphens, forward slashes, and underscores.</li>
            <li> The name must start and end with a letter or number.</li>
            <li> Must be unique within the [namespace].servicebus.windows.net\ URL namespace.</li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Subscription</h4>
          <p>Subscriptions are not constrained by the URL hierarchy inside Azure and have a very liberal naming requirement. Subscription names should be based off of the topic name and the subscribing entity. For example the school-course-listener would be a good name for a subscription from the “School Course Listener” Windows Service.</p>
          <p>Subscription names must conform to the following rules:</p>
          <ol>
            <li> Name should be at least 1 and at most 50 characters long.</li>
            <li> The name can contain only letters, numbers, periods, hyphens, and underscores.</li>
            <li> The name must start and end with a letter or number.</li>
            <li> Must be unique within the topic namespace.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Conclusions</h3>
          <p>The choice of naming conventions (and the extent to which they are enforced) is often a contentious issue, with developers holding their viewpoint to be the best and others to be inferior. Moreover, even with known and well-defined naming conventions in place, some developers may fail to consistently adhere to them, causing inconsistency and confusion. These challenges may be exacerbated if the naming convention rules are internally inconsistent, arbitrary, difficult to remember, or otherwise perceived as more burdensome than beneficial.</p>
          <p>These conventions discussed in this paper try to strike a balance between developer productivity and happiness with the needs of the organization. This document will be updated when better naming practices have been discovered during real world use of Azure by Grand Canyon University developers.</p>

      <description>This post is going to be a little different than my normal Xamarin.Forms posts. I want you all to know that I am more than a pretty interface. I have architectural and distributed systems chops as well.
I currently work for a local university that needs a solution for taking attendance for the first 3 weeks of every semester. You see, the university I work for is not an attendance taking university, but we need to satisfy a government requirement to take a student&amp;#8217;s attendance to get financial aid.</description>

      <description>Most of my career as a developer has been spent making web apps behind corporate firewalls. But, in the past couple of years, I&amp;#8217;ve had the pleasure of doing more public facing work.
This page holds a small collection of my private and corporate public facing work. For source code, please check out my GitHub repositories.
Programming I&amp;#8217;ve been programming ever since my mom bought me a Commodore 64 back in 1985 for Christmas when I was 12.</description>

      <description>Adam J Wolf Hello! Thanks for coming to my little place on the internet. I&amp;rsquo;m glad you stoped by. If you have any questions or want to comment, please find me on Twitter and fire away.
Most of my work is behind corporate firewalls but you can find some of it in public here, here and here. A summary of them is here as well.

    <p>Most of my career as a developer has been spent making web apps behind corporate firewalls. But, in the past couple of years, I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of doing more public facing work.</p>

    <p>This page holds a small collection of my private and corporate public facing work. For source code please check out my <a href="http://www.github.com/awolf">GitHub</a> repositories.</p>

    <h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
    <img src="C64.png" class="alignright"/>
    <p>
    I&#8217;ve been programming ever since my mom bought me a Commodore 64 back in 1985 for Christmas when I was 12. Basic was my first programming language and it was all downhill from there.</p>

    <h3 id="backend">Backend</h3>

    <p>
      If I had to choose between backend and frontend programming, it would have to be backend by the slimest of margins. Very slim.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fullstack development with a JavaScript frontend and a cloud based backend is my perfered way of building systems. Whether the backend is in C# on ASP.Net, JavaScript on Node.js, or even Python on Google AppEngine it dosent matter.

    <h3 id="frontend">FrontEnd</h3>

    <p>
      Backends are great but without a user interface you have something only a command line jockey can use. I wanted more impact than that.
    </p>

    <p>
      With HTML, JavaScript and CSS I've made some nice UI for the browser. With Xamarin and Xamarin Forms my mobile iOS and Android apps don't look bad at all.

    <h2 id="design">Design</h2>

    <p> <img src="sketch-icon.png" width="175" class="alignright" alt="Sketch app logo" />A couple of years ago, while working on a web app front end, I got fed up with my lack of design skills. I was embarrassed to show it to my client and I vowed to do something about it.</p>

    <p>It&#8217;s now a few years later. With some hard work and learning, I think my designs are good but not great. I am a work in progress. Still learning and experimenting.</p>

    <p>
      Here are some web sites, iOS and Android apps I've designed.

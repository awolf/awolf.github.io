        Hi, I'm the editor and chief of this boy band. I make sure everyone stays out of trouble and that good grammer rules are followed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides grammer and policing my boys, I like to get outdoors as much as possible. I'll take one or all three of them with me to get some fresh air and exercise. I love Arizona and don't miss New York, except for the Chinese food and bagels.

        Hello, I'm Washington, and for some reason, I was named after the state of Washington. My job, even though I've been told differently, is to protect the house. I do this by barking and howling at everything in front or in back of the house.
      </p>
      <p> I keep telling these humans that the little kid next door is trouble. Don't worry, I'm not all business, I love a good snuggle when I'm off work.

        Howdy, I'm Alabama. I am also named after a U.S state. I respond to many names, names like Bam, Bama, Bambam, bama-lama-ding-dong and the one where I'm in trouble "Aaallllllaaaaabama!!!". I also respond to anyone holding a treat or a peice of cheese. Especially cheese. Yum, I love cheese.

        My favorite activities include listening to Adam make tippity, tappity sounds at the computer while trying to get some rest. I have a hard life.

  Most of my career as a developer has been spent making web apps behind corporate firewalls. But, in the past couple of years, I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of doing more public facing work.
This page holds a small collection of my private and corporate public facing work. For source code, please check out my GitHub repositories.
Programming I&#8217;ve been programming ever since my mom bought me a Commodore 64 back in 1985 for Christmas when I was 12.

Most of my work is behind corporate firewalls but you can find some of it in public here, here and here. A summary of them is here as well.

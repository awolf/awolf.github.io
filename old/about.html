        <div class="content-area">
          <p>I have  been writing software programs for many years, and in those years, many people in the technical community have helped me by answering my questions and offering me guidance. In the latter half of 2007, I decided that I needed to give back to that generous community. Since that time, I have joined different local and national groups, where I have been able to put my years of experience to good use helping the community. I encourage everyone to join a local tech community and participate in the discussion.</p>
          <h2>Phoenix Silverlight Users Group</h2>
          <p>The Phoenix Silverlight User Group is an association of developers in the greater Phoenix Arizona area that are passionate about Silverlight.</p>
          <h4>Using the Silverlight Prism Framework</h4>
          <p>The Composite Client Application Guidance(Prism) is designed to help you more easily build modular Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Silverlight client applications. These types of applications typically feature multiple screens, rich, flexible user interaction and data visualization, and role-determined behavior. They are “built to last” and “built for change.” This means that the application’s expected lifetime is measured in years and that it will change in response to new, unforeseen requirements.</p>
          <h2>Southeast Valley .Net Users Group (SEVDNUG)</h2>
          <h4>Dependency Injection</h4>
          <p>The presentation will cover the common uses of a dependency injection container and show how they can help create applications that are more testable, maintainable and resilient to change. The presentation will also cover some common development principles like SRP, LSP, OCP and ISP.</p>
          <h4>Tool Time – Developers Edition</h4>
          <p>The presentation will be a comparison of productivity tools for Visual Studio. I will be showing all in attendance how much better my tools are than the #ReSharper product. Do not get me wrong, people love Resharper; I just can’t understand why.</p>
          <h4>ORM Shootout</h4>
          <p>The local SEVDNUG community is putting an a no holds bar ORM shootout. Passionate developers with their favorite ORM will do battle over the same database to prove ORM superiority. I will be defending Microsoft with thier latest and greatest LINQ to SQL.</p>
          <h4>Architecting SOA Services with WCF, WF and MSMQ</h4>
          <p>In this talk,you will get an overview as to how the Microsoft stack of technologies make creating highly available and durable services easier than ever before.</p>
          <h2>Endorsments</h2>
          <h4>Hanuman Haeseler President, Hazelnut Labs, Inc.</h4>
          <p>Adam is an expert software developer, talented systems architect, and a leader. I’ve had the pleasure of working closely with him on several complex facets of the Shared Solutions initiative which will fundamentally transform MedImpact’s business, and his deep technical knowledge, problem solving skills, communication\collaboration capabilities, and experience in creating innovative solutions which leverage proven academic and industry implementation patterns have resulted in the creation of a best-of-breed business platform. I enjoy collaborating with Adam, and would recommend him for any future endeavor.</p>
          <h4>Joshua Thornes Owner, Interdev Corporate Solutions</h4>
          <p>He is a talented solutions architect who is hard working, adaptive, enjoys learning, and sharing his knowledge that he has gained over his many years of development. Builds great user interfaces, and combines proven practices with the latest technology to build complete architectural solutions. The best connected system developer I have ever worked with. He truly understands how and more importantly when to implement connected systems. He is very good at all aspects of development. Great communication skills and great at understanding what the client is requesting.</p>
          <h4>Curt Gilman Consultant, Arizona Department of Administration</h4>
          <p>Adam Wolf is a passionate and talented programmer who elevates the art of software development to the level of a master craftsman. In a space dominated by code cowboys and slick salesmen, he is unsatisfied with merely grabbing a familiar tool and hammering out a solution with it. He goes deep into the technologies he uses, learning a new language or a development framework the way a sculptor learns a new medium, and applying his knowledge to the situations for which it is best suited. When he develops a solution, he carefully weighs the requirements of the client while remaining uncompromising in his architecture. Adam inspires not only the people he works for, but also the people he works with. I am proud to have had the pleasure of working with him for over eighteen months. I can wholeheartedly recommend him for a project of any size that requires serious technical and architectural leadership.</p>
